Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: c(
      person(given = "David",
             family = "Zimmermann-Kollenda",
             role = c("aut","cre"),
             email = "david_j_zimmermann@hotmail.com"))
Description: Allows you to define rules which can be applied to a
    dataset to check if the data conforms to your expectations.
    The package acts as a thin wraper around more powerful data backends such
    as dplyr, data.table, arrow, and DBI, which do the heavy lifting.
